# Timepiece

Create a time-based composition for the browser. It should _respond_ to time, but doesn't need to be a _clock_.

Simple example: http://cc.andydayton.com/timepiece/

## Assignment

Your finished project will be evaluated using following questions:

 1. Did you demostrate your process?
 2. Does the code utilize literal time in some way?
 3. Was it submitted correctly? (i.e. correctly uploaded to the server)
 4. Does it work?
 5. Does it demonstrate change over time?
 6. Was it executed well overall?

### Part 1: Design (Due 11/6)

 1. Sketch out **3** different concepts of a composition for the browser that demonstrates the "change over time"
  * 1 of them should be something that you think is reasonably attainable based on what you already know
  * 2 of them should be "blue sky" ideas that you don't necessarily know how to do
  * Each concept should include images and text, but you can document them however you prefer (photos of hand-written notes, mockups in Photoshop, a [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/) site with annotated images, etc.).
  * Please indicate which concepts are the "blue sky" ones and which is the more attainable one.
 2. Pick one of the "blue sky" ideas and research how you might make it a reality. Document your research with your own notes about how you _might_ make it happen.

Part 1 of this assignment can be submitted via your class Google doc.

### Part 2: Prototyping (Due 11/13)

 1. Select one of the concepts to move forward on.
 2. Next, think about what you will need to do to make your idea happen. Make a list of the steps you think you'll have to take.
 3. Pick the most difficult thing on your list, and attempt to build it in the simplest way you can imagine.
  * It doesn't need to look like your final product -- it can be a different size, it can use different content, it can be really, really ugly. But it should explore this question: _how could I build this?_.
  * Pay careful attention not only to what you are trying to build, but what you are intentionally _leaving out_. A good prototype should only include the bare minimum when you start.
  * If it turns out that your first step was easier than you thought, celebrate and move on to the next one! If it turns out to be even harder, think about how you might break it down into simpler parts.

You can [download this project here](https://github.com/parsons-cc/timepiece/archive/gh-pages.zip) to get started!

Part 2 of this assignment can be submitted via public link, email, or Google Drive.

### Part 3: Execution (Due 11/20)

Continue the work of your prototype to finish your project. You may want to change your final product based on the prototype, which is totally fine. The goal is to stay true to your original idea but also be able to finish it in time.

We will review and critique the final projects in class. Good luck!

Part 3 of this assigment may be submitted via public link.

### Resources

You can use the date/time functions provided by p5.js:

 * [`day()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/day)
 * [`hour()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/hour)
 * [`minute()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/minute)
 * [`millis()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/millis)
 * [`month()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/month)
 * [`second()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/second)
 * [`year()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/year)


## Project Setup

For basic functionality you can just double-click on `index.html` and open in your browser (Chrome is preferred). If you want to do things like load images, video, or sound or other advanced p5 features then you might want to use the local server instructions below.

### Local server

If you want to use more of p5js's functionality, you may need to run a local server for development. [You can find instructions here.](https://gist.github.com/daytona1/3a687b46a43236055819)
